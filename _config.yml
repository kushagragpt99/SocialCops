# Challenge 1: Agriculture Commodities, Prices & Seasons

Aim: Your team is working on building a variety of insight packs to measure key trends in the Agriculture sector in India. You are presented with a data set around Agriculture and your aim is to understand trends in APMC (Agricultural produce market committee)/mandi price & quantity arrival data for different commodities in Maharashtra.

## Objective:
1. Test and filter outliers.
2. Understand price fluctuations accounting the seasonal effect
3. Detect seasonality type (multiplicative or additive) for each cluster of APMC and commodities
  3.1. De-seasonalise prices for each commodity and APMC according to the detected seasonality type
  3.2. Compare prices in APMC/Mandi with MSP(Minimum Support Price)- raw and deseasonalised
4. Flag set of APMC/mandis and commodities with highest price fluctuation across different commodities in each relevant season, and year.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kushagragpt99/SocialCops/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
